Assignment 
Using the URL below
https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=53.82&longitude=-9.5&current=temperature_2m
Write a python program called currentweather.py that will print out the current temperature on the console (and only the temperature)
I have set the lat/long to my location, you may use that or a different location.
Last few marks:
Look at the documentation (below) and print out the current wind direction (10m) as well.
