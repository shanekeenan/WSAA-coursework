Assignment

Using the URL below

https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=53.82&longitude=-9.5&current=temperature_2m

Write a python program called currentweather.py that will print out the current temperature on the console (and only the temperature)

I have set the lat/long to my location, you may use that or a different location.

Last few marks:
Look at the documentation (below) and print out the current wind direction (10m) as well.

data = response.json()
#with open("weather.json", "w") as cso_json:
#    json.dump(data, cso_json, indent = 4) # using the indent agrument formats the .json file.. avoids having to use shift+alt+f 

temp = data["current"]["temperature_2m"]

print(f'Current temperature at Mace Head: {temp:.2f}¬∞C' )
