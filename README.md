Coding for assignments and lab for Data Representation module of semester 2 HDip in Data Analytics at ATU 



# Exercise 1.1

Create an XML file that stores data for a library (You can create this manually, I am not asking you to create a program to do this). 

The library has two catalogues (technical books, and for cookery books).

Each catalogue can contain a number of books (say 2 for the purpose of this exercise) . 

Books will have an ISBN, title and author.

Upload your .xml file to your github repository called data-representation-coursework
