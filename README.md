# data-representation-coursework
Coding for assignments and lab for Data Representation module of semester 2 HDip in Data Analytics at ATU 

Author: Shane Keenan 




# Exercise 1.1

Create an XML file that stores data for a library (You can create this manually, I am not asking you to create a program to do this). 
The library has two catalogues (technical books, and for cookery books).
Each catalogue can contain a number of books (say 2 for the purpose of this exercise) . 
Books will have an ISBN, title and author.
Upload your .xml file to your github repository called data-representation-coursework

# Assignment 3 

Write a program that retrieves the dataset for the "exchequer account (historical series)" from the CSO, and stores it into a file called "cso.json".

Upload this program to the same repository you used for the XML assignment
Save this assignment as "assignment03-cso.py"
This program should not be a long one
I don't need you to reformat or analyse the data in any way
It should be about 10ish lines long (I have not counted)
You will need to find the dataset in CSO.ie, try economic and then finance, then finance indicators. yes it is difficult to find, that is part of the task, actually the easiest way to find it is search for it.

# Assignment 4 

Write a program in python that will read a file from a repository, 
The program should then replace all the instances of the text "Andrew" with your name
The program should then commit those changes and push the file back to the repository.
I do not need to see your keys (see lab2, to follow)
Handup: Save the program as assignment04-github.py to the same repository you uploaded the xml to
Marks: Marks will be given for the functionality and layout of the code; I do expect minimal comments to indicate you know what the program is doing.
